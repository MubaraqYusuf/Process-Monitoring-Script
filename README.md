Detailed Description
Purpose and Scope
The primary goal of ScriptFile.ps1 is to reduce the manual effort required to manage Windows systems by automating routine maintenance tasks. It is built with flexibility in mind, allowing system administrators and power users to customize the script to meet their unique requirements. The script covers a broad range of functions including, but not limited to:

System information retrieval and reporting.

Automated backup routines.

Software installation and update procedures.

Environment monitoring and alerting.

How It Works
Initialization:
The script begins by performing system checks and establishing the necessary preconditions. It verifies that all dependencies are met and that the environment is correctly configured for subsequent operations.

Task Execution:
Based on the parameters supplied by the user, the script executes a series of predefined tasks. Each task is encapsulated in its own function, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance.

Error Management:
Robust error handling ensures that failures in individual tasks do not interrupt the overall flow. All errors are caught, logged, and can be reviewed later for diagnostics.

Output and Logging:
Detailed logs are generated and stored for review. Additionally, the script provides clear on-screen messages to inform the user about the progress and status of each task.

Customization and Configuration
ScriptFile.ps1 is built with customizability at its core. Users can configure various options by modifying parameters at the top of the script or by passing arguments when executing the script. The configuration section includes settings for:

Specifying log file locations.

Enabling or disabling specific tasks.

Adjusting verbosity levels for output.

Defining paths for backup or data collection.

Example Usage
To run the script with default settings, simply open PowerShell as an Administrator and execute:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\ScriptFile.ps1
For advanced usage with custom parameters, you can pass arguments like so:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\ScriptFile.ps1 -Task "Cleanup" -LogPath "C:\Logs\script.log" -Verbose
This command runs the “Cleanup” task, writes detailed logs to C:\Logs\script.log, and outputs verbose information to the console.
